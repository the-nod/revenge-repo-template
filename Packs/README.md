# Iconpacks for Vendetta Themes+!

What is this? This is Iconpacks for Themes+ (fork from Rosiecord with some changes, and more iconpacks which I made)

## How to use

1. Install Themes+ plugin (by nexpid): https://vendetta.nexpid.xyz/themes-plus
2. Apply a theme that support Themes+
   (in case you want to use default themes or client themes, skip Step 2)
3. Enable Themes+ plugin
4. Go to Themes+ plugin settings, tap on "Configuration"
5. Click mode, then choose "Manual"
6. Scroll down and click "Custom" (*1)

    1. On "URL" put iconpack link
     - Deco Icon: Available via Iconpack list! Or if you want the link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dora727/doraa-pyoncordstuff/master/Packs/Deco/
     - Material Two Tone Icon (*2): Available via Iconpack list! Or if you want the link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dora727/doraa-pyoncordstuff/master/Packs/MaterialTwoTone/
     - Plumpy Icon: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dora727/doraa-pyoncordstuff/master/Packs/Plumpy/
     - SecondPlumpy Icon (which i changed some icons): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dora727/doraa-pyoncordstuff/master/Packs/SecondPlumpy/
     - Iconsax Icon (un-done for un-rosiecording lol): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dora727/doraa-pyoncordstuff/master/Packs/Iconsax/
    2. On "Icon Suffix" put @2x or @3x (@2x recommended)
6. Close Configuration, tap "Reload".

Enjoy!

(*1). If you wanna use iconpack that available in list, then choose any iconpack you want.
(*2). If you use Material Two Tone via Custom pack, do not put anything in suffix.
